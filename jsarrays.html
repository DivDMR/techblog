    <h2>Arrays</h2>

    <p>
        Arrays are similar to objects to an extent and are just another type of variable as a string or integer is.
        A JS array functions very similar to that of a python list and has a numerical index on its entries, something an object doesnâ€™t have
        Here is an example of an array: <br>
        let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana'] <br>
        As seen above an array is declared the same way as any other variable and it has a square bracket around it instead of curly brackets.

    <p>Above we took on a challenge of creating a program that calculates the average/mean of a list of numbers in an array. 
        We created 4 different programs of increasing complexity and efficiency starting off with a very simple program that used primitive values and a hard coded average.
        After that we then went on to use an actual array and calculated the average by adding the sum of all the indexs ([0-4]) and dividing it by the length of the array. 
        However, this is still inefficient as if you add an index to the array then you have to rewrite the sum and keep adding to it. 
        Next we used a while loop to iterate over the array and add to the variable "sum" to give us the total of the array, and then simply divided by the length of the array. 
        Finally, Mr. Leboeuf showed us a way to do this program in only one line by using the .reduce() method. I don't quite understand it fully but it seems to have reduced the array into only two items and added them together and then divided by the length of array once again.

    <p>Above we were introduced to the .split() method in Javascript. 
        In this case the method lets you take an array and split it up based on a certain character. 
        For example if you wanted to split up array everytime there is a space you would do .split(" ") as seen above.
    </p>

    <p>Addiontally we learned about the .reverse() method which is simply a way to reverse the order of string. 
        This can be very useful as it is a super simple way of reversing the whole order of the array. 
        For example after using the reverse method index[0] would become the last item in the array and so forth.
