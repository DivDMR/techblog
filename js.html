    <h1>Javascript Notes</h1>

    <h2>Writing JS</h2>

    <p>JavaScript should be added at the end of the body tag because JS generally will affect HTML elements and a browser loads sequentially. Therefore, if at the top the JS will try to affect elements that haven’t even been rendered yet
        Additionally, it also affects the load time of the website making it load slower
        You can add javascript in 3 ways. <br>
        Inline <br>
        “script” <br>
        “script:src” <br>
        Although not necessary in most cases using a semicolon ( ; ) at the end of your lines is recommended as there are rare cases where it is necessary to.
        Addiontally a comment in js is written by using two slashes.
    </p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>
        There are three keywords to declare a variable: <br>
        <strong>var</strong> -  <br>
        With “var” the value within can be changed
        var is an older way of creating variables used in earlier versions of JS
        var has a scope that functions differently that sometimes allows variables inside of a function to be accessed outside of the function.
        Realistically nowadays there is no good reason to use var 
        It is better to just use “var” and “const” <br>
        <strong>let</strong> - <br>
        With “let” the value can also be changed later on <br>
        <strong>const</strong> - <br>
        Const is immutable which means that it cannot be changed
    </p>

    <h2>Operators</h2>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p>
        In JS a function is defined by the keyword “function”
        Proper Syntax would be as follows:
        "function FunctionName(parameter 1, parameter 2)" <br>       
        You have the “function” keyword followed by the name of the function along with a set of parentheses. 
        Inside these parentheses, you have the parameters that you will pass through the function. <br>
        An example of a full simple function would be this:
    </p>

    <p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="js,result" data-slug-hash="abyProK" data-user="divdmr" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

    <h2>Object</h2>
    <p>
        Objects are very widely used in programming and as well in Javascript.
        An object is just like a variable and is defined using “let” or “const” however, it has information stored with curly brackets. <br>
        As you can see at the end of the page, an object is written with “name:value”/”key:value” pairs.
        This allows you to store much more information within a single variable as compared with simple strings and integers.
    </p>    

    <h2>Loops</h2>

    <p>
        Loops are a very useful tool that is used in most program languages and are defined in Javascript with the “for” and “while” keywords (both behave slightly differently)
        A for loop is most commonly structured like this:
    </p>

    <h2>Arrays</h2>

    <p>
        Arrays are similar to objects to an extent and are just another type of variable as a string or integer is.
        A JS array functions very similar to that of a python list and has a numerical index on its entries, something an object doesn’t have
        Here is an example of an array: <br>
        let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana'] <br>
        As seen above an array is declared the same way as any other variable and it has a square bracket around it instead of curly brackets.
    </p>

    <h2>Arrays Continued</h2>

    <p>Above we took on a challenge of creating a program that calculates the average/mean of a list of numbers in an array. 
        We created 4 different programs of increasing complexity and efficiency starting off with a very simple program that used primitive values and a hard coded average.
        After that we then went on to use an actual array and calculated the average by adding the sum of all the indexs ([0-4]) and dividing it by the length of the array. 
        However, this is still inefficient as if you add an index to the array then you have to rewrite the sum and keep adding to it. 
        Next we used a while loop to iterate over the array and add to the variable "sum" to give us the total of the array, and then simply divided by the length of the array. 
        Finally, Mr. Leboeuf showed us a way to do this program in only one line by using the .reduce() method. I don't quite understand it fully but it seems to have reduced the array into only two items and added them together and then divided by the length of array once again.

    <p>Above we were introduced to the .split() method in Javascript. 
        In this case the method lets you take an array and split it up based on a certain character. 
        For example if you wanted to split up array everytime there is a space you would do .split(" ") as seen above.
    </p>

    <p>Addiontally we learned about the .reverse() method which is simply a way to reverse the order of string. 
        This can be very useful as it is a super simple way of reversing the whole order of the array. 
        For example after using the reverse method index[0] would become the last item in the array and so forth.
    </p>

    <h2>If Statements</h2>

    <p>
        An if statement is a logical statement that works a lot like our brains
        The essence of it is “if these things are true do this, otherwise, if these things are true do this, if none of those things are true do this” 
        The syntax goes as follows:
